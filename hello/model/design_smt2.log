-- Executing script file `design_smt2.ys' --

1. Executing RTLIL frontend.
Input filename: design_prep.il

2. Executing HIERARCHY pass (managing design hierarchy).

2.1. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \hello

2.2. Analyzing design hierarchy..
Top module:  \hello
Removed 0 unused modules.
Module hello directly or indirectly contains formal properties -> setting "keep" attribute.

3. Executing DFFUNMAP pass (unmap clock enable and synchronous reset from FFs).

4. Printing statistics.

     $ne                             2

5. Executing SMT2 backend.

5.1. Executing BMUXMAP pass.

5.2. Executing DEMUXMAP pass.
